# Begin React Project

This repo contains a basic project that I have created while learning React. I am implementing the new and fundamental concepts I have learned into this project and documenting the progress here.

## About the Project

In this project, I am developing a simple web application using React. The application aims to provide users with the XYZ feature. I have currently set up the basic structure of the project and started developing some components.

## Learning Process

This repo serves as a learning journal for me during my journey of learning React. Here are some key concepts that I have learned throughout this process:

- How to create and use React components
- Working with JSX syntax
- Understanding the difference between props and state
- Implementing page routing using React Router
- Making API requests using the Axios library

I am working on applying these concepts in practice and utilizing them in the project.
